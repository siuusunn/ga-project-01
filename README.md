# GA PROJECT 01 - ALICE LO

## Project description

As the first project in the SEI course, we need to build a web game using JavaScript. I chose Snake Game as it was one of my favorite games when I was a kid, and I remember vividly playing this game on my mom's Nokia 8210. This has been a fun project to work on, and to polish and challenge my JavScript skills.

I dedicate this project to my mom and her white Nokia 8210 from 1999. :)

## Planning

All my planning for this project were either drawn or written out on Excalidraw.

My first step of planning was to list out all the features that the MVP should have:

Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.

Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.

Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use?

Any pseudocode?
